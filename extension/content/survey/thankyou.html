                                <p class="help">Thank you to everyone who filled out the survey letting us know which Personas Plus features are most important to you. Tens of thousands of you completed the survey!</p>
                                <p class="help">The ability to install themes privately on your own computer was rated most important, followed by easy access to your favorites. Easy access to featured themes and recently used themes tied for third. The ability to use Personas Rotator came in last, but that was expected, because Personas Rotator users make up only a fraction of Personas Plus users. The results from the other questions tell us that rotating features are indeed important.</p>
                                <p class="help">A community developer has stepped up and offered to help maintain Personas Plus in the immediate future. We will revisit this decision again in six months to a year, and will do our best to continue supporting the features most important to you.</p>
